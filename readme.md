# Bindings
You can create custom binding by creating umvc3_noclip.ini file inside your game folder

Create a bindings section inside this folder => ["Bindings"]

After your bindings you can bind a key by using the bind name followed by the key of your bind.
You can find the binds here http://cherrytree.at/misc/vk.htm

There are the bind names:
- Speedup
- Forward
- Backward
- Left
- Right
- Up
- Down
- RotX
- RotX
- RotY
- RotY

Here is an example of how it would look like to change Forward to W & Backward to S
```
[Bindings]
Forward = 87
Backward = 83
```
